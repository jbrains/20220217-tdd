# Add Fractions

- 1/2 + 1 = 3/2     # add integer to non-integer
- 1/2 + 2/2 = 3/2   # add integers that are not in lowest terms
- 2/3 + 5/3 = 7/3   # improper fractions, not mixed fractions
- 1/3 + 2/3 = 3/3   # same denominator
- 2/5 + 4/3 = 26/15    # relatively-prime denominators
- 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4    # denominators have a common factor
- 4 + 6 = 10
- 0 + 6 = 6
- 4 + 0 = 4
- 0 + 0 = 0       # kernel: start here
- null + anything = ????

- 1 = 3/3 = 6/6 = 9/9 = -23/-23
- 1/2 = 4/8 = 3/6 = -97/-194
- 3/-7 = -3/7   # the customer prefers negative on top, not on bottom
- -9/-4 = 9/4
